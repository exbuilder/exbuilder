We recommend [as predicted](aspredicted.org) for a simple way to preregister experiments. From their website: 

>  To pre-register a study on AsPredicted, a researcher answers nine simple questions about their research design and analyses. The platform then generates a short, time-stamped pre-registration document that is easy to share and easy to read. 

You can store your preregistrations in this folder, or delete this folder if you don't need it.
